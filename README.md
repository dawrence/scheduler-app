# SCHEDULER

## SCHEDULER
This repository has been created as a code challenge for candidates with FullStack Labs. The candidate will clone and setup an existing Django application. The application will contain routes, migrations, models, and minimal views but with no actual functionality created. The candidate will show all her/his expertise building apps with the Django framework and problem solving skills.

## Overview
HeyURL! is a service to create awesome friendly URLs to make it easier for people to remember. Our team developed some mockup views but don't have our awesome functionality in place yet.

## Requirements
Implement actions to create shorter URLs based on a given full URL
If URL is not valid, the application returns an error message to the user
We want to be able to provide click metrics to our users for each URL in the system. Every time that someone clicks a short URL, it should record that click and also user platform and browser using the user agent request header
We want to create a metrics panel for the user to view the stats for every short URL. The user should be able to see total clicks per day on the current month along with a breakdown of browsers and platforms
If someone tries to visit a invalid short URL then it should return a custom 404 page
Unit Tests should be created which cover the code that is added as applicable

### Short URL Format
Max length 5 character e.g. NELNT
Allows upper and lower case characters
Allows numbers
Any non letter or number characters are not allowed, including whitespace
original_url and short_url must be unique
Original URL format should be validated

## Getting Started

1. Clone repository

2. Install Ruby 2.5.1

```sh
$ rvm install 2.5.1
```

3. Install PostgreSQL >9.4

```sh
$ brew install postgresql
```

4. Run setup
```sh
$ bin/setup
```

## Considerations

1. Check routes defined in `config/routes.rb`
1. Check controller actions in `app/controllers/urls_controller.rb`
1. Check views in `app/views/urls/`
1. Google Charts is already added to display charts, you can use any library
1. Use the `browser` gem already installed to extract information about each
   click tracked
